# Identify Yourself

My name is Carl McDonnell and I'm a Dublin, Ireland-based graphic designer. I have extensive experience providing design solutions for dozens of clients over two decades. My client base covers many business sectors, including publishing, banking, law, FMCG, healthcare, property management, construction, IT, e-learning, education, photography, newspapers and many more.
I'm a multi-platform designer, comfortable with both PC and Mac, but it would be fair to say the vast majority of my work is produced on Mac (the first commercial design computer I used was a Mac Plus, so that gives you a idea of timescale). I love playing with software and besides the industry staples (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator) I use Dreamweaver, Flash, AfterEffects, Keynote, iBooks author, Resolume. Occasionally on-site, I still need to go back to the good old days of Quark Xpress and (gasp!) Freehand, but those occasions are rare now. I'd love more time to use 3D software but I've dabbled in it for over 10 years, using 'old-school' software such as infini-D, Bryce, but have used Maya and 3D Max several times.
Anyway, this site is basically a project overview of my work over the past few years, with a few 'oldies' thrown in for good measure. I hope you see something you like. Feel free to comment or contact me with any suggestions, criticisms or queries. Enjoy.
