# Grace Under Pressure

## Performance graphics that add a new dimension to live shows

2112 Live at the Button Factory, Dublin - 2015-16\. 

I produced all live video for this 2 hour live show. Collaborating with the band's founder Ian Smyth, I came up with the conceptualisation and execution of video and graphics for every track on the night. I used Resolume, AfterEffects and Adobe Premiere to produce/edit the clips over a six month period and Resolume to trigger each one in sync with the music on the night. The effect was hugely dramatic and added a visual narrative for the audience.
