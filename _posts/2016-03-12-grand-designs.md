# Grand designs

An identity that perfectly captures the ethos of a company builds equity in the brand and projects a differentiated image. When the identity is unique and relevant, it helps make a positive first impression and gets the conversation off to a good start. By contrast, an unattractive or outdated corporate identity makes these goals harder and more expensive to accomplish. I've added several examples of strong clean corporate identity that I executed over the past several years.
